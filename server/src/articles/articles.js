Today it’s a key ingredient in many high‐demand food products, especially since partially hydrogenated soybean oil became popular in food manufacturing in the 1970s. While the aggregate demand for soybean oil has grown over the years, consumer appetites and attitudes toward “unhealthy fats” have changed, and that has opened doors for high oleic (HO) soybeans. Today, there are premium market opportunities for American farmers to deliver soybeans to local elevators, resulting in a strong domestic market. U.S. farmers have a huge opportunity, and responsibility to feed this growing demand. <br><br> Quantity was the biggest demand‐driver in the soybean oil market, but in recent years that has begun to shift to quality. Today’s High oleic soybeans — those with higher oleic acid content that eliminates the need for hydrogenation, thus making them a healthier alternative to conventional soybeans when processed for vegetable oil — fill the supply needs, with the required attributes. The identity‐preserved varieties available to farmers today meet consumer demand for healthier cooking oil while offering competitive agronomic performance and a premium farm price. In short, today’s HOSoy represents an opportunity for farmers to supply a domestic market they have created. <br><br> As we enter the 2021 growing season, rising demand across the supply chain means HOSoy soybeans represent a strong value proposition for growers, grain handlers, food processors and retailers as the supply chain coordinates throughout the system. The HOSoy value chain is built, now the chain needs a solid hook at the farm level with soybean growers consistently providing the supply food processors need to meet this demand. <br><br> There are challenges for producers, however. Some are real. Some are merely perception, but they all must be overcome to keep this developed market a reality. Previously, as the market developed, myriad challenges persisted that limited growers’ ability and desire to accept this opportunity. Through the efforts of farmers, grain handlers, and other participants in the HO Soybean value chain, these challenges have been addressed. <br><br> This paper explores the rising value of the quality‐based market for growers, including: <ul> <li>Existing and growing demand means this is a long‐term premium opportunity worthy of farmer consideration.</li> <li>The reality that these seed varieties hold as much or greater yield potential than conventional soybeans.</li> <li>There are widely available weed control options available for growers. Meeting requirements for these U.S. based contracts have more lenient protocols than traditional identity preservation handling procedures. These premium contracts require meeting only a minimum oleic content when delivered to the elevator.</li> <li>Food processors and distributers are committed to this market, see the long‐term market potential, and just need U.S. farmers to provide the products.</li></ul>',

    body: 'High Oleic Soy Market Outook <br><br> Soybean oil has long been a major component of the consumer, industrial and commercial vegetable oil complex, but as end‐user preferences have shifted, a market for healthy oil has developed. Previously, that market relied mostly on canola or cottonseed oil, but preferences are changing. After years of research and field testing funded by the U.S. Soybean Checkoff, food companies are poised to increase demand with high oleic soybeans. <br><br> The global cooking oil market, of which soybean oil is a major component, is expected to continue the demand surge that’s been underway for years. According to <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/17/1538399/0/en/Global-Cooking-Oil-Market-Will-Reach-USD-130-30-Billion-by-2024-Zion-Market-Research.html" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Zion Market Research </a>the worldwide cooking oil market was valued at more than $85 billion in 2017, and that’s expected to exceed $130 billion by 2024, with annual growth of more than 6%. <br><br> The <a href="https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/oilseeds.pdf" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">USDA Foreign Ag Service</a> says worldwide vegetable oil production from various oilseeds has grown from 188.36 million metric tons in 2016‐17 to a projected 215.9 million MT in the 2021‐22 marketing year. Soybean oil currently accounts for nearly 29% of total worldwide vegetable oil production, with U.S. soybean oil holding a 6% share of the world market. When whole soybean exports destined for overseas crush facilities are factored in however, that total jumps to nearly 11% of the worldwide total vegetable oil market from United States‐produced soybeans. <br><br> That share can continue escalating and it is poised for growth here at home with contracts for delivery to U.S. elevators. There is a market in the United States for homegrown soybeans that provides a great opportunity for U.S. soybean farmers to build and maintain a premium market. There is domestic demand, it’s growing, and it promises to grow in the future. <br><br> <blockquote>North America is estimated to grow at a higher CAGR during the forecast period 2020‐2025 owing to the rising disposable income and an increase in the fermentation and drilling process. Increasing demand for soybean oil in the preparation of sauces, dressing, non‐dairy creamers, whipped toppings and increasing usage of soybean oil in fighting against conditions such as obesity, high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease is increasing the growth of the soybean oil market in this region. Source: Industry ARC; Soybean Oil Market – Forecast (2021 ‐ 2026)</blockquote> <br><br> Consumers prefer the flavor and health benefits with minimal trans‐fatty acids (TFA) and saturated fat. Normally, the two are mutually exclusive; whenever hydrogenating a cooking oil source, TFAs decline but saturated fat and oxidative instability rise, as do adverse health effects of consuming partially hydrogenated oil, like increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and type‐2 diabetes. <br><br> This is where real opportunity is for U.S. soybean farmers with high oleic soybean production to build, maintain, and grow a market with specifically desirable traits food processors, chefs and consumers prefer. <br><br> At the same time, cooking oil made from HO soybeans with low linolenic acid levels perform on par with conventional cooking oils from a shelf‐stability standpoint, while low linolenic acid contents contribute to improve shelf stability and long‐term viability of the finished oil product. <br><br> Once food companies discovered the value of HO soybeans, the fundamental changes necessary for them to begin manufacturing products with HO soybean oil didn’t happen immediately. That transition — one that’s taken five to seven years for many food manufacturers to adjust procedures, equipment and other components of the entire process — is nearing its end. <br><br> Companies that eliminate TFAs in products are ready to begin using HO soybean oil. The marketplace is poised to connect growers and processors to these end‐users and their consumers. And now, the production side of the supply chain is almost a decade into developing the infrastructure and systems to deliver. <br><br> With a growing market base in the United States, there is added benefit to American soybean farmers. U.S. producers have an opportunity to supply a stable and growing domestic market at U.S.‐based crush facilities. This means this localized market is less susceptible to foreign competition and potential international trade disputes because the market is U.S. based and relies on U.S. produced crops. The soybeans are grown, processed, and sold to consumers right here at home. <br><br> High oleic soybeans now represent the impetus for vegetable oil that’s the best of both worlds for the consumer. With limited seed supply in 2021, acreage increases are required to meet demand in 2022 and beyond.',

    body: 'Marketing and logistics options exist throughout the trade area for 2021. Currently, three processors purchase HO soybeans from growers at a range of premiums based on how growers produce, market and store the crop throughout Indiana and Ohio, and the Delmarva/Pennsylvania region. <br><br> With a processing facility in Salisbury, Maryland, and partnering with 17 grain elevators in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Maryland, Perdue is the HO soybean processor and grower partner for farmers in the Delmarva Peninsula. The HO soybeans are accepted at up to 14% crop moisture, with a discount schedule beyond that level for delivery to four of its locations. <br><br> Perdue offers premiums starting at 50 cents/bushel. If farmers store their HO soybeans on‐farm and make them available for delivery at high‐demand times, that premium increases to 65 cents/bushel. If HO soybeans are planted on 100% of a grower’s acres devoted to the crop, the premium rises to 75 cents/bushel. <br><br> Currently with 16 grain elevator partners in Indiana and Ohio, ADM is the grower partner and processor for farmers in the eastern Corn Belt, with its processor in Frankfort, Indiana. Four of the locations are ADM facilities where growers can sign up for harvest delivery contracts, with one location accepting on‐farm storage contracts. Premiums from ADM are similar to Perdue; for HO soybeans stored on‐farm and under 15% moisture (14.5% at some locations), the premium is 75 cents/bushel, while the premium is 55 cents/bushel when the crop is delivered at harvest. <br><br> Bunge takes delivery at 24 locations in 2021. Premium options for 75 cents/bushel exist if a farmer is willing to store the crop and participate in a preferred buyer call between December 2021 and August 2022. Farmers who prefer to deliver at harvest will receive a 65 cent/bushel premium. The Bunge contract calls for a 14% maximum moisture. <br><br> Though the HO soybean market was limited to these areas for 2021, it’s expected to expand for 2022 and beyond. Plans are underway for new HO soybean contracts, with acreage expected to grow to almost twice 2021 levels in 2022 and beyond in future years.',

    body: 'A soft IP program allows some room for error at the farm level. The contracts are based on the commitment from the grower to plant a specific Plenish variety for 2021, so the requirements at delivery are somewhat lenient compared to traditional IP programs. High oleic oil content in soybeans is a genetic trait, meaning there’s not the variety of oil output compared to other crop output traits, so meeting the oil requirements is less restrictive. <br><br> Conventional soybean oil is composed of approximately 60% polyunsaturated fatty acids, 25% monounsaturated fatty acids and 15% saturated fatty acids, whereas, HO soybean oil is made of around 75% oleic acid, with 20% less saturated fat and 2% to 3% linolenic acid. Eight percent of conventional soybean oil comprises linolenic acid, contributing to relative shelf instability compared to HO soybeans, which is why the low‐linolenic content is desirable. That is all in the genetics. <br><br> As a “soft IP” program, farmers can account for what minimal oil content variance individual loads may show in testing by blending. As long as the grain meets minimum thresholds for oil contents on an aggregate level, it meets the requirements for processing as high oleic soybean oil. Strict farm‐level grain segregation is not necessary; as long as the soybeans meet the processor’s oil requirements at the right crop moisture levels, they’re accepted. <br><br> A Simple On‐Farm Process:<br> <ol> <li>Clean seed hopper or boxes before planting HOSoy varieties.</li> <li>Mark fields where planting HOSoy varieties begins and ends.</li> <li>Run out a combine prior to and after harvesting HOSoy.</li> <li>Clean bins, trucks, and wagons prior to handling HOSoy to maintain purity.</li> </ol> <br><br> As an example, Perdue requires 65% oleic acid content with their loads, which should be achievable with normal grain handling procedures. Harvest equipment and storage facilities should be cleaned before storing HO Soybeans for the premium contracts, but the perception that equipment needs to be pristine is not accurate. The test is for minimal oil content based on the production of the approved varieties. If small amounts of unapproved varieties are in the load, it is acceptable if the delivered load contains the minimum required oil content. <br><br> Testing typically takes less than 1 minute to complete, and a small number of loads are tested for sampling purposes. Tactically, this typically means farmers delivering HO soybeans to an elevator indicate their cargo via a placard and are directed to bins where the identity‐preserved (IP) grain is stored.',

    body: 'Transportation and storage exist regardless of the crop, so HO Soybeans cost no more than any other production. Storage capacity in HO soybean production regions is a key piece of the puzzle to sustaining the premium program.<br><br> For transportation, estimate what it costs to have someone locally haul grain. There needs to be a charge from the field to on‐farm storage if it’s available, as well as from the farm to the processing facility. Typically, within 15 miles $.06‐$.10/bushel will cover the cost from field to storage. From there, it just depends on how far the cost is to the processing facility, who is trucking it, or if it is being picked up will‐call on the farm.<br><br> The other way to calculate the cost is knowing exactly how much trucking costs in fuel, maintenance, labor, overhead, depreciation, inflation, appreciation, and repairs annually. Take that number divided by the total bushels hauled on average to arrive at a per bushel cost.<br><br> For storage and drying it is the same as any other crop. For commercial storage, simply input the flat fee or the cost to store per month times the number of months stored. If the soybeans are stored on‐farm, this number can be a bit trickier. There are four things to consider:<br> <ol> <li>Amount of Storage</li> <li>Principal and Interest payments remaining on the storage.</li> <li>Life expectancy of the grain system</li> <li>Will there be upcoming upgrades?</li> </ol> <br><br> What we need to be careful of is not over‐inflating the cost on an annual basis. <br>Example: <br><em>100,000 bushels of storage</em> <br><em>$50,000 of debt 20‐year life expectancy</em> <br><em>$50,000/100,000/20 = $.025 or $.03/bushel in storage.</em> <br><br>If there is significant grain‐handling equipment such as grain legs, dryer, etc. a general rule of thumb for handling is $.03 in and $.03 out.
